 ## Description
 For week 10, my project was to create an application using the inquirer package and jest. The goal was to create an application that would generate a simple SVG logo using the user inputs as a reference. I was also told to create different classes representing each shape so in my application if you were to look at the code you would see multiple files with a different class representing the 3 shape choices given to the user. 

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself.

 ## Usage
 As stated in the description the main usage of this project is to provide the user a quick and easy way to generate a basic SVG logo

 ## Contributions
 For this project I would like to give credit to Justin Feaggin a classmate in my Bootcamp who helped me with the test.js files.<br />
 I also used w3Schools to help me with getting some of the shapes for this assignment https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp.<br />
 Finally I referenced old assignments from the previous week and used some examples from the module page of canvas.
